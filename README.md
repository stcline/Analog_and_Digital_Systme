# :robot: Analog and Digital Systems

## ü§ì Overview and learning outcomes 

Working with digital electronics allows us to build automated systems that can solve problems.  In this activity you will use what you have learned about these concepts to build a system that reads an analog sensor and a digital sensor that work together. üöÄ

## The System you will build

Equipment Needed:
- V5 Brain
- Bumper (Kill Switch)
- Encoder
- Motor (With a gear attached)

## Pseudocode

This chart represents the problem to solve.

## üìù Next steps

Your submission will include a markdown file titled, "results.md", a python script titled, "analog-digital.py" and a video of your working system.
1. Build the system.
2. Program the brain using VEXCode V5.
3. Shoot a video of your working system.
4. Create a Python file here titiled, "analog-digital.py" to this repo.  Copy all of your code from VEXCode and Commit.
5. Create a file titiled, "results.md".  In this file include the following information:
    - A description of your process to solve this problem
    - The most difficult parts of the coding problem
    - A real world application of this system 
6. On Google Classroom click, "Mark as Done"
